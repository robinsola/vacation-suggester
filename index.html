Yes, that's a fresh butter tart cooling in the oven just in time for second breakfast, or is it elevensies already? Oh, who's even counting?...</p>

Don't you worry, here at the Overlook Hotel, there's a whole lot of time and a whole lot of solitude to do just about anything. You'll find everything you need here. A fully stocked bar, a typewriter, an axe... And who knows, maybe you'll just end up meeting some nice new "forever" friends. Oh, and I think you'll especially enjoy room 237.</p>
